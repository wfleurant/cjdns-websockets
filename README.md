Requires [pywebsockets](https://code.google.com/p/pywebsocket/). Access cjdns's UDP interface with websockets!

Usage
-----
    python standalone.py -d /path/to/this/git -p 8888

visit localhost:8888/cjdns.html in your browser. Be amazed. That demo html page could be spruced up a bit, it doesn't do much just now.
